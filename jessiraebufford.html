        <h2>
            Throughout my academic journey, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from California State University Northridge, where I maintained a commendable GPA of 3.41. During my time at CSUN, I actively engaged in collaborative group projects, honing my teamwork and problem-solving skills. These experiences equipped me with a solid foundation in computer science and the ability to thrive in a collaborative environment. My resilience is a key strength that has been integral to my success. I possess the unwavering ability to persevere through challenges, ensuring that I consistently meet and exceed expectations. Additionally, my effective communication skills enable me to articulate my thoughts in a way that resonates with diverse audiences, fostering understanding and cooperation. Having navigated the challenges of independent living while working full-time minimum wage jobs, I recently made the bold decision to step away from those roles to focus on training with Revature for a full-time .NET full-stack developer position. My determination to break free from the entry-level label drives my pursuit of real professional experience and the ultimate goal of securing a permanent position within a forward-thinking company.
