		  <table><tr><td>
        <p>Growing up in a Southern Californian household, I was constantly curious about the workings of new
                technologies. I enjoy tinkering and learning about most mechanical and electrical objects, resulting in
                my desire to develop. Throughout my childhood, I would discover computer software that would aid me with
                taking the first steps into programming. <em>Game Maker Studios</em>, known back then simply as <em>Game
                    Maker</em>, taught me the basics of programming through it's proprietary "GML" scripting language.
                Most of my teenage years were filled with me developing my own visions into small PC and mobile video
                games. Walnut High School is where I would have my first educational introduction into mainstream
          programming languages, with lessons being taken for Macromedia Flash and C.</p>
        <p> After high school, I attended Mt. San Antonio College, then transferred to California Polytechnic
              University, Pomona as a <em>Business Administration: Computer Information Science</em> major with a
              focus in Application Developement. Here I was able to take the knowledge of programming I have gained
              throughout my adolescence and properly apply it utilizing widely-accepted conventions.</p>
        <p>Aside from computer technology, I have developed plenty of hobbies. Here's a quick list: <ul><li>Skateboarding, having entered plenty of competitions throughout my life.</li><li> Music, including live shows, and playing guitar and drums</li> <li>Archery, competing internationally within the discipline of Olympic Recurve.</li>
          <li>Motorsports (you can often find me working underneath my vehicles)</li>
		  <li>Fitness (lezzo gym bros)</li></ul></p></td>
