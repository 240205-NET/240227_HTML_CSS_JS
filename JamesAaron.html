    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        Born in 1989, James has achieved a number of great feats. From riding a bicycle
        without falling down, to being able to wash his own clothes. Eventually, James 
        learned how to type courtesy of Mavis Beacon. ames went on to dabbling 
        in math, and was eventually able to teach it, though the sanity of his pupils, as 
        well as other mathematicians is questionable. Now, James is persuing a career in 
        Full stack development, though it does not show any promise of him finding his 
        sanity again.
