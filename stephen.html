    <h2>Hobbies/Outside of Work Interests: </h2>
    <ul class="hobbies">
        <li>Cooking: I love to cook just about anything, but my favorite is 
            Asian inspired food.  Thai curry is super tasty (the spicier the better!)
        </li>
        <li>
            Baking: I've been baking since I was young (same with cooking) with my Mother
            and Grandmother, and now myself from time to time. My favorite to make is a 
            chocolate cake with chocolate ganache inbetween the layers and a buttercream frosting.
        </li>
        <li>
            Basketball: Love to watch the game and play occassionally.  Super into the NBA (more a 2000s and before guy though)
            My favorite team is the Chicgo Bulls and my favorite player of all time is Vince Carter.
        </li>
        <li>
            Music: I love to listen to music of all types (minus most Country and Screamo).  My favorite type of music comes from
            the 80s and before.  Synth-Pop and Soul music are my top genres. I also own over
            30 vinyl records.
