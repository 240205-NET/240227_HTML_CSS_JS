                    I am a determined and self-motivated software engineer graduate with experience in building production-ready web
                    applications in the .NET full stack. I have experience as a full stack developer through all software development phases
                    to provide enterprise-level applications. I love solving intricate and complex requirements and enjoy putting in the
                    effort to fulfill them. I am also an exceptional team player that works collaboratively to write functional and high
                    quality code to build the framework and infrastructure for an assigned project.
                    
                    I am highly knowledgeable in frontend and backend programming and leverage industry standard tools and Agile methodology
                    to strengthen development initiatives. I am able to multi-task and change priorities based on the client's needs and
                    work under the direction of a supervisor to meet goals and expectations. My passion for software engineering fuels me to
                    constantly update my professional and technical skills with the latest technology and tools to be versatile with the
                    work requirements. My experience with multiple coding languages such as Java,C# and JavaScript allows me to work with
                    different teams and different tools to grasp concepts quickly and offer flexible solutions.
