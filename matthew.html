			<p class="about-me--paragraph">I was born in Los Angeles, California and graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English Literature. I've always had an interest in technology. When I was 4 years old, my parents purchased a computer running Microsoft Windows 3.1 PC, and I was immediately hooked. After graduating from UCLA, I started developing an interest in computer programming and began learning how to code websites and web applications. And here I am now!</p>
