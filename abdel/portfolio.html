                The "Recipe Finder" application is meant for the average person that wants to cook at home, but doesn't know what to cook or how. This application will allow users to search for recipes, applying filters like country of origin, name of food, and ingredients included. It will also allow the user to add their own recipes to the database, allowing other users to discover their creations. The feature that ties all of this together is the meal planner, which allows the user to schedule their cooking and send reminders to themselves about the meal plan
